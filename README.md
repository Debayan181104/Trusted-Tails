Trusted Tails is an aspiring company dedicated to revolutionizing pet care through innovative technology and compassionate service.
This repository contains the prototype website for Trusted Tails, built using HTML, CSS, and advanced AI-driven design tools. The prototype showcases the initial vision for a user-friendly, 
modern website that will serve as the digital face of Trusted Tails, offering pet owners a platform for services, resources, or products (to be defined as the company develops).

The goal for 2025 is to transform this prototype into a fully functional website with dynamic features, such as user accounts, e-commerce capabilities, or AI-powered pet care recommendations.
